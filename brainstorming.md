# Top 3:
Country based trending movies

1. Mobile:
  Our app provides a quick and easy way to view movie trends by country
2. Story:
  The story behind our application is to connect users of different cultures through filmography. We believe that it would be a strong positive response
3. Market:
  The market realistically could encomapss the entire world as it is targeting movie goers from every country
  yes! our app would be etremely useful for individuals interested in foreign films
  The audience for the app would be anyone interested in travel and filmography
4. Habit:
  Users would be encouraged to open the applicaiton often in order to find out what is the latest movie trend
  The average user may use as an inspiration for their own film projects after viewing the contents of the app
5. Scope:
  The app does not appear to be that difficult in developing.
  A stripped down version of the app would still be interesting to develop
  We want this to be the go to app for trying to filnd good foreign films to further check out. (users would NOT be streaming form the app)
