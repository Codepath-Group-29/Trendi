# Top Three App:

1. Trendi:

- **Mobile:**
    - The app provides a quick and easy way to view movie trends by country

- **Story:**
    - The story behind our application is to connect users of different cultures through filmography
    - We believe that it would be a strong positive response

- **Market:**
    - The market realistically could encomapss the entire world as it is targeting movie goers from every country
    - Yes! our app would be etremely useful for individuals interested in foreign films
    - The audience for the app would be anyone interested in travel and filmography

- **Habit:**
    - Users would be encouraged to open the applicaiton often in order to find out what is the latest movie trend 
    - The average user may use as an inspiration for their own film projects after viewing the  contents of the app

- **Scope:**
    - The app does not appear to be that difficult in developing. 
    - A stripped down version of the app would still be interesting to develop
    - We want this to be the go to app for trying to filnd good foreign films to further check out. (users would NOT be streaming form the app)

  
2. Movie Fan Finder:

- **Mobile:**
    - The provides means to connect with cinephiles (movie lovers) like a global and local movie club but on phone!
    - Find peers to go watch new movies together

- **Story:**
    - The reasoning beind this application is to connect movie lovers together and find reasons to grow cinephile culture

- **Market:**
    - We believe this application scalable in a global growing market
    - It is no that same-old social media with loop holes but authetic application to bring and foster craze for movies

- **Habbit:**
    - Whenever a new movie of interest is out, user can get on and seeks peers to watch new movies
    - It is not an addictive app but an user can grow in application uses whenever needed

- **Scope:**
    - The scope of this application is a little beyond our course material
    - To make this application successful we have to work on things like database, GPS, and other security stuff which makes this project challenging to be completed in two weeks
